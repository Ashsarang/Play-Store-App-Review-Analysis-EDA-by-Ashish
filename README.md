**EDA - Play Store App Review Analysis**

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis on the Google Play Store apps dataset. It covers data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis.


**Problem Statement**

Given the vast repository of data available from the Play Store, the challenge is to formulate a comprehensive analysis that identifies key factors influencing app engagement and success. Specifically, this entails exploring app attributes such as category, rating, and size, as well as analyzing user reviews to gain insights into consumer preferences and sentiments. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that app developers can leverage to optimize their strategies, enhance app performance, and effectively capture the Android market


**Project Summary -**

Play Store, also branded as the Google Play Store and formerly Android Market, is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. Applications are available through Play Store either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the proprietary Play Store mobile app.

We are provided with the two datasets one containing the information about apps and the other consist of the user reviews and their sentiments about the apps. Our goal is to analyze the dataset and visualize the trends and relations between app features. There are many questions an app developer could come across while developing an app and our study will help in answering those questions. Our analysis is divided into three phases; understanding data, data preparation and data visualization.


**Business Objective?**

The wealth of data available from the Play Store presents a promising opportunity for app developers to propel their businesses towards success. By mining this data, developers can extract actionable insights crucial for capturing the Android market. Each app entry is rich with information such as category, rating, and size, providing a comprehensive view of the app landscape. Complementing this dataset is another containing customer reviews, offering invaluable feedback on app performance. Through thorough exploration and analysis of these datasets, key factors driving app engagement and success can be uncovered, empowering developers to make informed decisions and optimize their strategies for maximum impact in the competitive app market.
